# GitHub Actions Coverage Workflow Implementation

## Workflow Details

**File:** `.github/workflows/coverage.yml`
**Status:** âœ… Implemented
**Timestamp:** 2025-06-23T08:19:00Z

## Features Implemented

### 1. Coverage Collection
- âœ… Runs tests with coverage on PR branch
- âœ… Runs tests with coverage on base branch
- âœ… Uses existing `scripts/run-tests.sh unit` command
- âœ… Generates both `.out` and `.html` coverage reports

### 2. Coverage Comparison
- âœ… Compares PR coverage vs base branch coverage
- âœ… Calculates coverage difference (improvement/decrease)
- âœ… Package-level coverage breakdown
- âœ… Coverage status indicators (ðŸŸ¢ improved, ðŸ”´ decreased, âšª unchanged)

### 3. Coverage Gates
- âœ… Minimum coverage threshold: 70%
- âœ… Fails if coverage drops by more than 2%
- âœ… Automatic gate enforcement with workflow failure

### 4. PR Comments
- âœ… Sticky PR comments with coverage report
- âœ… Detailed coverage breakdown by package
- âœ… Coverage comparison table
- âœ… Links to coverage artifacts

### 5. Artifact Storage
- âœ… Stores PR coverage artifacts (30-day retention)
- âœ… Stores base branch coverage artifacts
- âœ… Coverage comparison reports
- âœ… HTML coverage reports for detailed viewing

### 6. Workflow Triggers
- âœ… Runs on pull requests to main/develop branches
- âœ… Ignores documentation-only changes
- âœ… Ignores helm chart changes
- âœ… Proper permissions for PR comments

## Workflow Structure

```yaml
Triggers:
  - pull_request events on main/develop branches
  - Excludes: docs/, *.md, charts/, docs workflow

Jobs:
  1. coverage:
     - Checkout PR branch
     - Run tests with coverage
     - Parse PR coverage results
     - Checkout base branch
     - Run tests with coverage on base
     - Generate coverage comparison
     - Post PR comment with results
     - Enforce coverage gates
  
  2. coverage-summary:
     - Generate workflow summary
     - Report overall status
```

## Key Permissions
- `contents: read` - Read repository contents
- `pull-requests: write` - Post PR comments
- `issues: write` - Update issue comments

## Coverage Thresholds
- **Minimum Coverage:** 70%
- **Maximum Decrease:** -2%
- **Gate Enforcement:** Workflow fails if thresholds not met

## Artifact Retention
- **PR Coverage:** 30 days
- **Base Coverage:** 30 days
- **Comparison Report:** 30 days

## Integration with Existing Workflow
- Uses existing `scripts/run-tests.sh unit` command
- Maintains compatibility with current test setup
- Leverages existing Go coverage tooling
- Complements existing `test.yml` workflow

## Next Steps for Integration
1. Coverage gates can be configured in branch protection rules
2. Coverage trending can be tracked via stored artifacts  
3. Integration with external coverage services (optional)
4. Coverage badges can be generated from workflow results
